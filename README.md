Catitizer
=========

- Makes faces into cats.
- Code needs alot of work still, go easy on meee.
- Faces that aren't getting catitized are not being detected by the framework below... It doesnt seem to like beards very much.


Stuff I Used
============
  - request : for grabbing websites
  - express : fast server setup
  - jsdom : virtual DOM on the server side to simulate jquery and inject code.
  - fs : filesystem access
  - http-get : for image scraping
  - now : more fun to use then ajax
